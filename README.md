Planing to make:

	EC2 Inspector – check running instances, unused ones, CPU/memory stats.
	2.	S3 Cleaner – list buckets, highlight large objects, optionally delete old files.
	3.	Security Auditor – scan security groups, IAM roles, open ports, unused keys.
	4.	RDS Monitor – show database instances, storage usage, backup status.
	5.	Lambda Analyzer – list functions, invocations, errors, cost per function.
	6.	CloudWatch Reporter – gather logs, metrics, set alerts summaries.
	7.	Budget Tracker – extended version of the billing tool with alerts when spend exceeds thresholds.
	8.	Tag Checker – enforce tagging policies across resources.
	9.	EBS Snapshot Manager – list snapshots, show age/size, automate deletions.
	10.	Resource Cost Optimizer – suggest downsizing or stopping idle resources.
